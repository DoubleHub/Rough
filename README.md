# Rough v1.0
My first public CS:GO cheat. It doesn't work on any kind of GUI, only on classic cmd shell. That's why it's called "Rough".
However, it's my first release, so don't blame me so much! :)

## Warning!

This cheat will need a directory, created in C:\, which will contain all the INI config files for the cheat. I suggest you creating it before launching the cheat, so everything will go smooth. You can download the directory from here, of course.

## The cheat offers:

- No Flash
- Rage Aimbot
- Slow Aim
- Triggerbot
- Glow ESP
- Radar (not working atm)
- Bunny Hop

## I'd like to add:

- Skin Changer
- Silent Aim
- RCS
- Box ESP
- Bone ESP

## CREDITS:
I must say thanks to all of these people:

WasserEsser - Made inVincibleLib, which I used as a base for my EdgeLibrary, which I used in order to make this cheat.

PhY1z - Made BHOPSKILZ, an open-source cheat made with educational purposes, infact from it I've learned how to make the Glow ESP, the SlowAim and the Radar.

## CHANGELOG:

- 1.0
  - Public release
